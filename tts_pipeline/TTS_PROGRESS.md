# TTS Pipeline Implementation Progress

This document tracks the step-by-step implementation progress of the TTS pipeline system.

## Implementation Steps Completed

### ✅ Step 1: Setup Project Structure
**Date:** January 18, 2025  
**Status:** COMPLETED

**Actions Taken:**
- Created basic directory structure for the TTS pipeline
- Established all core directories: `config/`, `tracking/`, `output/`, `logs/`, `scripts/`, `utils/`
- Verified directory creation was successful

**Intent:**
This foundational step established the organized structure that houses all TTS pipeline components. Each directory has a specific purpose:
- **`config/`** - Configuration files (Azure settings, processing parameters)
- **`tracking/`** - Progress tracking and state management files
- **`output/`** - Generated audio files
- **`logs/`** - Processing logs and monitoring data
- **`scripts/`** - Core processing scripts
- **`utils/`** - Utility functions and helpers

The structure follows the plan outlined in `TTS_PIPELINE_PLAN.md` and provides a clean foundation for the remaining implementation steps.

### ✅ Step 2: Create .gitignore File
**Date:** January 18, 2025  
**Status:** COMPLETED

**Actions Taken:**
- Created a comprehensive `.gitignore` file in the `tts_pipeline/` directory
- Added exclusions for sensitive data including `.env` files and Azure credentials
- Included exclusions for generated audio files, logs, and tracking data
- Added standard Python project exclusions (cache files, virtual environments, etc.)
- Included IDE and temporary file exclusions for clean repository management

**Intent:**
This security-focused step ensures that sensitive information like Azure API keys, generated audio files, and processing state data are never accidentally committed to version control. The `.gitignore` file protects:
- **Environment variables** (`.env` files) containing Azure credentials
- **Generated content** (audio files, logs, progress tracking)
- **Development artifacts** (Python cache, IDE files, temporary files)
- **System files** (OS-specific files like `.DS_Store`)

This maintains the security principle established in the plan where credentials are stored in environment variables and never committed to the repository.

### ✅ Step 3: Setup Config Files
**Date:** January 18, 2025  
**Status:** COMPLETED

**Actions Taken:**
- Created `azure_config.json` template file with non-sensitive Azure TTS settings
- Created `processing_config.json` template file with processing parameters and configuration
- Both files are located in the `config/` directory as planned

**Intent:**
This step established the configuration foundation for the TTS pipeline:

**`azure_config.json`** contains:
- Voice settings (Steffan Neural voice, English US, male gender)
- Audio format specifications (24kHz, 160kbps MP3)
- Speech parameters (rate, pitch adjustments)
- Technical limits (max text length, timeout settings)
- Default values that will be overridden by environment variables for sensitive data

**`processing_config.json`** contains:
- Directory paths for input/output
- Processing parameters (min audio duration, retry settings)
- File pattern matching for chapter identification
- Logging and performance settings

These template files allow users to customize the TTS pipeline behavior without exposing sensitive credentials, which remain securely stored in environment variables. The configuration files provide a clean separation between operational settings and authentication data.

**Note:** User modified the `azure_config.json` to change voice_gender from "female" to "male". Configuration approach uses default values in JSON with environment variable overrides for sensitive data (API keys) to be implemented in future steps.

### ✅ Step 4: Implement Chapter Discovery
**Date:** January 18, 2025  
**Status:** COMPLETED

**Actions Taken:**
- Built `utils/file_organizer.py` with comprehensive chapter discovery functionality
- Implemented recursive directory scanning for volume and chapter files
- Created pattern matching for `Chapter_XXX_Title.txt` files and volume directories
- Added file validation to ensure chapters are readable text files
- Implemented proper sorting by volume number, then chapter number
- Successfully tested and discovered 1432 chapters across all volumes (including Side_Stories)

**Intent:**
This core component enables the TTS pipeline to automatically discover and organize all chapter files in the correct processing order. The file organizer provides:
- **Automatic Discovery**: Scans the extracted text directory structure
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies chapter and volume files using regex patterns
- **Sequential Sorting**: Orders chapters by volume, then by chapter number
- **File Validation**: Ensures files are readable and contain valid text content
- **Metadata Extraction**: Provides chapter titles, file paths, and size information
- **Progress Integration**: Supports finding next chapter based on completed work

The organizer successfully discovered 1432 chapters across 9 volumes (including Side_Stories as volume 9), confirming the system can handle the full scope of the LOTM book series.
